                    <p>
                        There's a moment in life where the days drag. Life gets a little harder, a little less bareable, and you can't help but feel empty. You sit there, contemplating your every living moment in existence, wondering how time passed by so quickly, or what you did wrong in this or that moment. It is easy to get lost in the racing thoughts which cloud your mind. Constantly trying to answer "what comes next?". Why am I acting this way, and why isn't there anything I can do about it.
                    </p>
                    <h3> "Maybe it's just me."</h4>
                    <p> 
                        I've done a little thinking lately, trying to figure out the roots of my actions and my supposed passions. I'm a firm believer that everyone's actions, demeanor, and  habits are all defined in one way or another by underlying feelings, insecurities, or stories of their past. For me, my strength physically and mentally comes from my lack of self-worth earlier in my life, whether it be the criticism about my weight or my weirdness and less than stellar social skills. I withdrew into my own shell for a good majority of my life, feeling largely unable to succeed at much. I found a lot of peace thinking to myself, thinking about a hopeful future where I finally feel like anything I do would be worth something. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> "Yet, I felt so empty."</h3> 

                    <p>
                        Even though I had these thoughts for over a decade of my life, I never saw myself able to succeed in any manner, and I never realized what I was capable of. <b>Until College.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       More specifically, this past year. More or less, I had two traumatic experiences happen to me in a relatively short time period, which forced me to completely reevaluate my life. My worth, my calling, etc. Every moment that I felt like I made a breakthrough, I was flung ten steps back, either by my own criticality or life's own burdens. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>"The same voices haunting and taunting me became the ones in my head."</h3>

                    <p>
                        I was tired of feeling like I was stuck in a low place. I felt tired of falling over and over again, each time that I made progress. Every time I got up, I felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper into an abyss. Deep, dark, into the depths of my own inner demons and fears. There was a moment where I just sat at home for a couple of days, my ego hanging aimlessly by a thread. 
                        <br>
                        <br> In that moment, I decided to give up control.
                         
                    </p>
                    <h3>Control is an illusion after all.</h3>

                    <p>
                        You can only do so much until the amalgamation of all forces around you collapse into one moment and influence what directly affects you.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Being vulnerable is an opportunity to start fresh and start anew in one way or another. What you do from there is up to you.
                    </h2>

                    <p>A quote from today:</p>
                    <h3>"Life is but one constant falling. People will always tell you, whenever you fall, you have to get back up. But the goal isn't to get back up after you fall because you'll just keep falling. But the hope is that you stumble in the right direction. A direction that will one day hopefully </h3>
